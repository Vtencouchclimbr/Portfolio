                A dedicated and versatile professional from Maryland, I bring a unique blend of technical and creative interests to <br /> 
                my role as a Software Engineer and Full Stack Developer. With a strong foundation from over 15 years in land surveying <br /> 
                and design for civil and structural engineering, I developed a keen attention to detail and problem-solving skills. <br />
                Beyond work, I enjoy an active lifestyle, immersing myself in the outdoors, and cultivating a passion for music. <br />
                Recently graduating from the University of Utah's Web Development Coding Bootcamp, I’ve built a comprehensive skill set <br /> 
                critical to modern software development. My technical expertise spans HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, SQL, <br /> 
                PostgreSQL, React, the PERN and MERN stacks, NoSQL databases, MongoDB, and Mongoose. Additionally, I’m experienced with <br /> 
                JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), Apollo, Vitest, Cypress, and Python, along with tools like CircleCI, Insomnia, Render, Netlify, <br /> 
                GitHub Actions, GitHub, and pseudocode. I bring strong problem-solving abilities and a solid foundation in AI and document <br />
                research. My five-year plan includes advancing to a senior developer role, becoming a team manager, and collaborating on <br />
                personal projects with fellow developers. Throughout, I remain committed to continuous learning, growth, and contributing to <br />
                high-impact projects within dynamic teams
